# Blog 5: Exploratory Testing: The Tester as an Investigator

## Introduction

While scripted testing verifies known requirements, **Exploratory Testing (ET)** is the simultaneous learning, test design, and test execution. It’s the art of thinking like a user who is curious, impatient, and perhaps even malicious. It's the most powerful technique for finding high-impact bugs that scripts often miss.

## What is Exploratory Testing?

* **Definition:** "Simultaneous design and execution of tests" (Whittaker, 2012).
* **Goal:** To learn about the software, discover unknown defects, and assess the product's quality and risk profile in a free-form, yet structured, way.
* **Key Skill:** **Oracles**—A set of principles or sources (like consistency, history, reputation) used to determine if the application's actual behavior is correct.

## Session-Based Test Management (SBTM)

To prevent ET from becoming aimless clicking, we use a structure called **Session-Based Test Management (SBTM)**.

### 1. The Charter

A charter is the mission statement for a specific testing session. It gives focus without overly constraining the tester.

* **Format:** **Explore** [target area] **with** [resources/tools] **to discover** [information/risks].
* *Example Charter:* **Explore** the user profile update page **with** various image file types and character sets **to discover** data validation flaws and server performance issues.

### 2. The Session

A time-boxed (usually 60-120 minutes) period of uninterrupted exploration based on the charter. During the session, the tester takes **session notes** covering:

* What was tested (coverage)?
* What bugs were found (defects)?
* What worked well (praise)?
* What questions or blockers arose (issues)?

### 3. The Debrief

The session ends with a review of the notes, allowing the tester to synthesize their findings and share the critical information with the team.

## Comparison: Scripted vs. Exploratory

| Feature | Scripted Testing | Exploratory Testing |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Purpose** | Verification of known requirements. | Discovery of unknown risks and defects. |
| **Documentation** | Extensive, written before execution. | Light, written during execution (Notes/Debrief). |
| **Flexibility** | Low (must follow steps exactly). | High (tester follows their nose). |
| **Best Used For** | Regression and regulatory compliance. | New features, high-risk areas, and ad-hoc releases. |

## Discussion Question

If you are given a completely new feature with no documentation, would you start with Scripted Testing or Exploratory Testing, and why?
