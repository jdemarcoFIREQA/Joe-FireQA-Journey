# 🧭 Blog 12: Mechanical Companions: When and How to Start Automation

## 🗺️ The Objective
To learn when to build "automations" to handle repetitive tasks, and when to keep the human touch.

## ⚔️ The Adventure
In any great quest, you eventually want a mount or a mechanical companion to handle the long, dusty roads (regression testing). However, building a robot takes time and resources. If the road changes every day, your robot will break.

### The Automation Criteria (The "Should I?" Test)
Before automating, ask:
1.  **Is it repetitive?** (Does it run every sprint?)
2.  **Is it stable?** (Is the UI finished, or is it still shifting?)
3.  **Is it high volume?** (Does it require 100 different data combinations?)

### Choosing Your Toolset
* **Selenium:** The elder statesman (widely supported, steep learning curve).
* **Cypress/Playwright:** The modern speedsters (fast, developer-friendly).

## 💎 The Reward
Effective automation frees the tester to perform "Exploratory Quests" (Episode 5), leaving the boring, repetitive checks to the machine.

## 💡 Discussion Question
What is one manual test you perform every week that you wish you could delegate to a "mechanical companion"?
